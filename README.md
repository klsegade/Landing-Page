# Landing-Page

Hello,

This is to be a foray of sorts
A test of skill
An exploration of talent
A challenge of the mind

Basically making another website from scratch. That's what I've gathered, anyway.

Let's get to it!

Notes after finishing and submitting:
Working on buttons was helpful ... understood better how to manipulate that.
Flexboxes feel much easier to work with now.
Overall learned a lot more comfortable with the basics, and while I may not be 
making the most condensed/optimized pages, I have a better understanding of how it 
clicks together.
